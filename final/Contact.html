    My Name is Yuri Strohm. I am 22 years old, and a Graphic Design major at Massachusetts College of Art and Design. I have been working on design since high school and have been motivated to pursue it as a career that I would  enjoy doing everyday. I have seen how my design change and process has changed through out the years with assistance from teachers and other students. Working on commissioned logo and branding jobs has helped me see how design works in the real world outside of the school environment.
